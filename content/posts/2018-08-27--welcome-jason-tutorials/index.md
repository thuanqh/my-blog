> "We must never forget that it is through our actions, words, and thoughts that we have a choice." ~Sogyal Rinpoche

I am also learning about giving - that giving to quench my own need will never be enough.

When I give, not from a full heart but from an empty space that needs recognition, I'm exhausted. Giving from my own need leads to resentment, victimhood, and financial distress. Yet, I know that giving from a full heart is replenishing and sustaining. It brings joy into my own life.
