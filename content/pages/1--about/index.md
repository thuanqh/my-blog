### What is it about?

This blog/tutorial is an educational project.

They say that the best way to solidify newly acquired knowledge is to teach it to somebody. That is what I am aiming at.

I will share with you what I have learnt. I expect that will strengthen my understanding of subjects I will write about. I also hope that you find it helpful.

So once again, it is an educational project. For sure for me, but chances are for you also. :)
